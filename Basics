- List Unique Values in a Column: SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;

## Aggregations and Summaries
- Count Distinct Values: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) FROM table_name;
- Calculate Average Value: SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
- Sum Values: SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
- Find Maximum and Minimum: SELECT MAX(column_name), MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
- Group By and Aggregate: SELECT column, COUNT(*), AVG(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;

## Data Slicing and Filtering
- Select with Specific Criteria: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
- Filtering with Multiple Conditions: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition AND condition2;
- Select with ORDER BY: SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
- Select with LIMIT: SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number;
- Using BETWEEN for Range: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column BETWEEN valuel AND value2;
